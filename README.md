# Support-vector-regression

## We want to hire a employee to our company, so we should predict this new employee's future salary because the employee is negotiating that he has 20 plus experience and earned 160k in his previous company, and now the employee is negotiating that he expects more than 160k to work for our company. Now we should predict his previous salary by fitting a model and check whether that he is telling the truth or bluffing.
